"""Minimal proxy for compact prompt rewriting + token counting.

The ONLY job of this proxy is to intercept auto-compact requests and rewrite
the prompts so Alpha stops and checks in instead of barreling forward.

This is a surgical intervention, not a full weaving layer:
- System prompt: already handled by SDK (we pass it directly)
- Orientation: already in first user message
- Memories: already in user content per-turn

We just need to catch:
1. The summarizer system prompt during compact → replace with Alpha's identity
2. The compact instructions → replace with Alpha's custom prompt
3. The "continue without asking" instruction → replace with "stop and check in"

Token counting (Feb 2026):
- Echoes each request to Anthropic's /v1/messages/count_tokens endpoint
- Tracks max(token_count, new_count) so warmup and tool-use noise is filtered out
- Fires a callback when count increases
- Reset is triggered by AlphaClient.query() on the first turn after compaction
  (not here — the proxy doesn't know when compaction is "done")

Debug mode:
Set ALPHA_SDK_CAPTURE_REQUESTS=1 to dump every request to tests/captures/
