"""Hand-off tool — context transition tool.

Called when ready to transition context. The tool
sets a flag; after the current turn's response stream finishes, the
client automatically sends /compact with her instructions, then wakes
her up in a fresh context with orientation and memories.

The tool requires a memory — you can't go to sleep without first
remembering something. The last thing you do before lights-out
should always be storing what mattered.

Auto-compact is the fire alarm. Hand-off is the bedtime routine.
