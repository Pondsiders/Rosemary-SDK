"""inference_client.py — shared AsyncOpenAI client for local/remote inference.

Every chat and embedding call in Rosemary-SDK goes through this module. The
underlying client reads `OPENAI_BASE_URL` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` from the
environment (see `.env`) and speaks the OpenAI REST API. Any compatible
endpoint works: Ollama's `/v1`, llmster (LM Studio), Harbormaster, a
llama-server on Modal, OpenAI itself.

Deployment knob: one line in `.env` points Rosemary at whichever backend is
serving today. No code changes.
